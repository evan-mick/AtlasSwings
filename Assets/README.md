# Atlas Swings

## Organization

You'll see a "_Codebase" folder, please put all code, scenes, materials, and other assets created by us in that folder. All the other folders are packages I (Evan) installed that I thought would be helpful to the project.

Cinemachine - for all the camera logic, it is one of Unity's packages. An overview of it can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ibDJhFVMU it was installed so that transitioning between the map, main camera view, and the projectile could be seemless

Blobcreate - contains the folders for the projectile trajectory stuff. Makes coding and visualizing projectile path much easier.

Destroyit - We may use for destruction, has built in functionality for using particle effects n such on destroy.
